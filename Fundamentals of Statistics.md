Let's suppose a coin has probability P of falling heads up. If we flip the coin many times, we would expect the proportion of
heads to be near p. We will make this formal later. Take P = .3 and n = 1,000 and simulate n coin flips. 
et's plot the proportion of heads as a function of n.

We can do the same experiment for P = .03.
