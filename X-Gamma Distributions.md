# The X-Gamma Distribution

Since the introduction of the original X-Gamma, there has been many variants of the XG distribution. This document will compare each of these distributions together, using simulations drawn from a similar distribution as well as applicable real data.

Lists of X-Gamma Variants:
<li>X-Gamma</li>
<li>Extended X-Gamma</li>
<li>Quasi X-Gamma</li>
<li>Inverse X-Gamma</li>
<li>Log X-Gamma</li>
