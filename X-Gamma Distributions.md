# The X-Gamma Distribution

Since the introduction of the original X-Gamma, there has been many variants of the XG distribution. This document will compare each of these distributions together, using simulations drawn from a similar distribution as well as applicable real data.

Lists of X-Gamma Variants:
<li>X-Gamma(XG)</li>
<li>Extended X-Gamma(EXG)</li>
<li>Quasi X-Gamma(QXG)</li>
<li>Inverse X-Gamma(IXG)</li>
<li>Log X-Gamma(LXG)</li>
<li>Two-parameter X-gamma distribution(TPXG)</li>
